# Security Tests

The contracts in this folder are the fuzz and symbolic execution scripts for the rolling distribution incentives contract.

## Fuzz

To run the fuzzer, set up Echidna (https://github.com/crytic/echidna) on your machine.

Then run
```
echidna-test src/test/fuzz/<name of file>.sol --contract <Name of contract> --config src/test/fuzz/echidna.yaml
```

Configs are in this folder (echidna.yaml). 

The contracts in this folder are modified versions of the originals in the _src_ folder. They have assertions added to test for invariants, visibility of functions modified. Running the Fuzz against modified versions without the assertions is still possible, general properties on the Fuzz contract can be executed against unmodified contracts.

Tests were run one at a time because they interfere with each other.

## LiquidationEngine

### General fuzz

Goal: Check for unexpected failures. Use contract GeneralFuzz.sol, with checkAsserts == true in echidna config.

### Overflow Fuzz

This script will fuzz a modified version of the LiquidationEngine, including a mock SafeEngine. The modified version will fire an assertion on overflows, results aim to provide an insight on safe bounds for all calculations in the contract.

For this we will fuzz both a safe state (collateral and debt), as well as collateral parameters.

If fuzzingboth collateral and debt, values close to the ones above will overflow, the case that was mostly reduced is the following:
                         129747088119.375309651257358574 
    115953324830350971415744056541225.015777259025135427 

We also tested fuzzing only debt, with: 1000 ETH collateral.

  Call sequence:
    fuzzSafe(1593573193211699743555714681088209368725398,115962318970534578672575213196172476289404989529599)

    value: 115962318970534578672575213196172.476289404989529599

### Conclusion: ETH and RAI balances turn overflows highly unlikely.

Fuzzing collateral parameters.

For 1000000 Coin adjustedDebt, an accumulatedRate of 115867312.542273104931626618209252766 will cause an overflow, or 115 trillion (USD?) value being auctioned.

### Fuzz Bids

Will setup an auction, and allow echidna accounts to bid, checking for the following properties:



### Auctions and bids

Will allow echidna accounts to initiate auctions and bid, checking for the following properties:
