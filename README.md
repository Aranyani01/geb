# B-RAI Protocol [Bitcoin Collateralised RAI]:

What is B-RAI: B-RAI is a stablecoin on the RSK [testnet] that utilises the same decentralised mechanisms as the stablecoin "RAI", but it uses the much larger/more secure collateral of Bitcoin, accessed via the RSK chain/Sovyrn.

True stablecoins like B-RAI differ from pegged coins like USDC and DAI as they maintain their stability *independent* of the state of the asset they are pegged to. Thus if USD were to fail, USDC and DAI would collapse, but B-RAI would maintain its stability.
