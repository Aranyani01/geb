# GEB

This repository contains the core smart contract code for Generalized Ethereum Bonds. While we intend to use the "GEB" terminology when we discuss about core architecture, the actual instrument issued by the protocol is called a reflex bond.

# What is a Reflex Bond?

A reflex-bond is a low volatility proxy for the underlying collateral that supports its value. The _future_ redemption price of a reflex bond depends on the market price deviation from its _current_ redemption.
