# GEB

This repository contains the core smart contract code for Generalized Ethereum Bonds. While we intend to use the "GEB" terminology when we discuss about core architecture, the actual instrument issued by the protocol is called a reflex bond.

# What is a Reflex Bond?

A reflex bond is an asset that mirrors the price movements of its collateral in a dampened way (and with lags between the underlying changing its value and the reflex bond system reacting to that). The _future_ redemption price of a reflex bond depends on the market price deviation from its _current_ redemption price. For more details, check the [whitepaper](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/whitepapers/blob/master/rai.pdf).
